# word-clock
Arduino code for an English NodeMCU-based word clock based on modifying an existing commercial product.

The project is described on the website [Color to the WordClock, april fools' edition](https://diystuff.nl/embedded/color-to-the-wordclock/) and is a fork of https://github.com/niekproductions/word-clock which is a fork of https://bitbucket.org/vdham/wordclock.

This fork has been specifically been changed to alter a completely different base clock. Words are being formed as a group of letters, not each individual letter. Here is how it looks when finished:
